        "q1": "Why should I claim with FlyCompense?",
        "a1": "Airlines can make claiming compensation tricky — delaying or rejecting claims and turning it into a frustrating, time-consuming process. That's where we come in. We handle the paperwork, negotiations, and all the hassle, so you don't have to. Our experts know air passenger rights laws inside and out, maximizing your chances of winning. And we only charge a service fee if we successfully secure your compensation.",
        "q2": "What do I need to claim compensation?",
        "a2": "You'll need your flight details (flight number, date, departure and arrival airports), booking confirmation or e-ticket, and a valid ID. If you have your boarding pass, that's even better!",
        "q3": "Can I claim compensation for the people I traveled with?",
        "a3": "Yes! You can claim on behalf of all passengers on your booking. Each passenger is entitled to their own compensation.",
        "q4": "Is there a time limit to make my claim?",
        "a4": "Yes, the time limit varies by country. In most EU countries, you have 2-3 years from the date of the flight. We recommend claiming as soon as possible.",
        "q5": "How long does it take to get my compensation?",
        "a5": "Most claims are resolved within 2-4 weeks. However, if the airline disputes the claim, it can take several months. We'll keep you updated throughout the process.",
        "q6": "What if the airline rejects my claim?",
        "a6": "Don't worry! We'll escalate your case and can take legal action if needed. We have a high success rate even with initially rejected claims."

            "a1": "If the airline that you flew with has gone bankrupt or otherwise no longer exists, you are not likely to receive your compensation even if you do submit a claim. Passengers usually are last in a long list of creditors. However, if your flight was operated by another airline, it is possible to claim compensation with them instead.",
            "q2": "The airline is offering to reschedule my flight. What does this mean?",
            "a2": "Airlines will offer to reschedule your flight if there has been a delay or disruption. They will usually offer you a new flight schedule, or in some cases, offer an entirely new replacement flight. You can accept or reject and seek refunds/compensation when covered.",
            "q3": "Can I get compensation for a codeshare flight?",
            "a3": "If your disrupted flight meets the necessary criteria — then yes. For codeshare flights, the airline who is operating your flight at the time of cancellation or delay is the one responsible for paying compensation.",
            "q4": "How long do I have to file a claim?",
            "a4": "The right to claim compensation does eventually expire under most laws, but the time limit varies. Some countries and laws only give you a few months to file a claim, others up to 10 years. Typically up to 3 years for EU claims; UK claims can be made up to 6 years after the flight.",
            "q5": "Can I get compensation if my flight was part of a package holiday?",
            "a5": "Yes. If your flight is delayed or canceled and meets the necessary criteria, you can claim for compensation from the airline. It is the airline's responsibility to compensate their passengers, so the laws apply even if the flight ticket was part of a package holiday.",
            "q6": "Can I claim compensation if I booked via an online travel agent (OTA)?",
            "a6": "Yes, if it meets the necessary criteria. You can claim compensation for any flight delayed by 3 hours or more, or if your flight was canceled less than 14 days before departure, and if your airline was considered at fault.",
            "q7": "When am I allowed to claim extra costs due to a flight disruption?",
            "a7": "You can claim unexpected expenses up to 2 years after a flight delay or cancellation if the costs incurred were a direct result of the disruption. This covers food and drinks, hotel bookings, and transport tickets.",
            "q8": "Who pays for my food and lodging if I have to wait several days?",
            "a8": "The airline is always responsible for providing you with care in case of lengthy delay or cancellation. They must provide you with food and lodging, transport to and from the airport, and access to communication.",
            "q9": "What do I do if my replacement flight was downgraded?",
            "a9": "Under EC 261, if your flight was canceled and the replacement flight downgrades your seats (e.g. business class to economy class), you can get reimbursed between 30% – 75% of the ticket price you originally paid.",
            "q10": "How can I protect my future flights against delays and cancellations?",
            "a10": "You can protect any future flights by purchasing travel insurance. Additionally, keep all booking confirmations, boarding passes, and receipts. Know your rights before you fly.",
            "q11": "Who can help me if the airline doesn't pay my compensation?",
            "a11": "If an airline refuses to pay your compensation, the next step is to take them to court. Thankfully, if you claim with FlyCompense, we handle all the legal procedures for you. We operate on a no win, no fee policy."
