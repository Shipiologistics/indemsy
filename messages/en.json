        "a1": "Airlines can make claiming compensation tricky — delaying or rejecting claims and turning it into a frustrating, time-consuming process. That's where we come in. We handle the paperwork, negotiations, and all the hassle, so you don't have to. Our experts know air passenger rights laws inside and out, maximizing your chances of winning. And we only charge a service fee if we successfully secure your compensation.",
        "q2": "What do I need to claim compensation?",
        "a2": "You'll need your flight details (flight number, date, departure and arrival airports), booking confirmation or e-ticket, and a valid ID. If you have your boarding pass, that's even better!",
        "q3": "Can I claim compensation for the people I traveled with?",
        "a3": "Yes! You can claim on behalf of all passengers on your booking. Each passenger is entitled to their own compensation.",
        "q4": "Is there a time limit to make my claim?",
        "a4": "Yes, the time limit varies by country. In most EU countries, you have 2-3 years from the date of the flight. We recommend claiming as soon as possible.",
        "q5": "How long does it take to get my compensation?",
        "a5": "Most claims are resolved within 2-4 weeks. However, if the airline disputes the claim, it can take several months. We'll keep you updated throughout the process.",
        "q6": "What if the airline rejects my claim?",
        "a6": "Don't worry! We'll escalate your case and can take legal action if needed. We have a high success rate even with initially rejected claims."
